# Our Development Philosophy
DBCâ€™s IT development is based on open source and service oriented architecture, thereby following the recommendations of The National
IT and the Danish Agency for Digitisation for public institutions.

We participate in [TING Concept Community](http://www.ting.dk/) with many Danish public libraries and library system suppliers. TING is an open source
community for user driven development in the Danish library sector. The vision is to promote cooperation, sharing and digital
development in cultural institutions for the benefit of end users. It is based on a service oriented architecture, which facilitates
openness, synergy and reuse of the services on many different platforms.

As a partner and member of TING Council, we return our development to TING in the form of source code, which may be used freely for
further development by all members of TING Community.

We use GNU Affero GPL 3 for Web services. GPL version 3 is used for all other software.
