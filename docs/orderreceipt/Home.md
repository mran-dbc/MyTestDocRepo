# Order Receipt
Order Receipt is not a complete web service, but rather a specification of a
service that must be exposed as part of a local library system to enable the
system to be updated with order receipts from the national ILL infrastructure.

Order Receipt WSDL v1.3 can be found [here](https://opensource.dbc.dk/websvn/filedetails.php?repname=WSContracts&path=%2ForderReceipt%2Ftags%2F1.3%2ForderReceipt.wsdl)

Order Receipt XSD v1.3 can be found [here](https://opensource.dbc.dk/websvn/filedetails.php?repname=WSContracts&path=%2ForderReceipt%2Ftags%2F1.3%2ForderReceipt.xsd)

Please note that the WSDL/XSD should be included in the local
implementation of the Order Receipt-web service. The URLs above are not to
be considered persistent and should therefore not be referenced directly
from any services, schemas, or instances of these.
